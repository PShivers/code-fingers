# Code Fingers

Welcome to Code Fingers, a project inspired by the wonderful site [Monkey Type](https://monkeytype.com/). While Monkey Type is a fantastic tool for improving typing skills, it may not provide a fully immersive experience for typing actual code. Code Fingers aims to bridge that gap by offering a typing practice platform that is specifically tailored to code blocks.

## The Goal

The primary objective of Code Fingers is to provide a typing practice environment that closely resembles the experience of coding. By focusing on code blocks, you can enhance your typing skills while also becoming more proficient at writing code. Whether you're a beginner seeking to improve your coding speed or an experienced developer looking to refine your skills, Code Fingers is designed to help you level up your coding abilities.

<!-- ## Features -->

<!-- 1. **Realistic Code Blocks:** Code Fingers offers a variety of code blocks sourced from real-world programming languages and frameworks. You'll encounter snippets ranging from simple statements to more complex code segments, providing a comprehensive typing experience across different programming languages. -->

<!-- 2. **Syntax Highlighting:** To simulate the coding environment, Code Fingers includes syntax highlighting for the code blocks. This feature ensures that you become familiar with the visual cues and color-coded representations commonly found in integrated development environments (IDEs) or text editors. -->

<!-- 3. **Customizable Challenges:** Code Fingers allows you to tailor your typing practice based on your preferences. You can choose specific programming languages, adjust the difficulty level, and even select the length and complexity of the code blocks you want to practice with. -->

<!-- 4. **Typing Metrics and Progress Tracking:** Keep track of your typing progress and improvement over time. Code Fingers provides detailed statistics and metrics, including typing speed, accuracy, and areas for improvement. You can review your performance history, identify your strengths and weaknesses, and focus on specific areas to enhance your coding speed and accuracy. -->
<!-- 
5. **Compete and Challenge Friends:** Challenge your friends or join the Code Fingers community in competitive typing sessions. Engage in friendly competitions, compare your typing speed with others, and strive to climb the leaderboards. Sharing achievements, participating in coding challenges, and collaborating with fellow coders can further enhance your typing and coding skills. -->
<!-- 
6. **Keyboard Shortcut Practice:** In addition to typing code blocks, Code Fingers offers exercises to improve your familiarity with common keyboard shortcuts used in various programming environments. Mastering these shortcuts can significantly boost your coding efficiency and productivity. -->
