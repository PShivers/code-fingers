## Code Fingers
this is a project that will be based upon the wonderful site [Monkey Type](https://monkeytype.com/). My only issue is that the ability to type code on there is not very robust, and it ends up being somewhat disjointed from typing actual code. The goal of this project is to give a similar feel to it but to be more focused on typing code blocks.
